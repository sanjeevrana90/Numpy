# Numpy

NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays.
It is short for "Numerical Python".
NumPy provides efficient and convenient functions for performing mathematical operations on arrays, such as element-wise addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
NumPy arrays are similar to Python lists, but they are more efficient for numerical computations.
NumPy arrays can have any number of dimensions, and each dimension is called an axis.
NumPy arrays can be created using the np.array() function, which takes a Python list as input.
NumPy arrays can also be created using functions such as np.zeros(), np.ones(), and np.arange().
NumPy provides functions for statistical analysis, such as np.mean(), np.std(), and np.max().
NumPy provides functions for linear algebra, such as matrix multiplication (np.dot()) and matrix inversion (np.linalg.inv()).
NumPy can be used in conjunction with other Python libraries for data analysis and scientific computing, such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and SciPy.
These are just some of the basics of NumPy. NumPy is a powerful library with many more features and functions, and it is widely used in data science, machine learning, and scientific computing.
